# Coding Tree log 

- What I did:
Finished the Tree and Node classes in tree.h.
Added functions like createRoot, addNode, findNode, printAll, and playGame.

- Problems I ran into:
I had a typo in the Tree constructor.
Also forgot to include <limits> for numeric_limits.

- How I fixed it:
Corrected the constructor and added the missing header.
